/** A destroyable singleton which keeps track of Vulkan wrapper object allocations and helps
 *  track leaking of ref-countable object instances.
 *
 *  The first ObjectTracker::get() call will instantiate the singleton. Any further get() calls
 *  will return the same handle until a ObjectTracker::destroy() call is made, which releases
 *  the tracker. After the tracker is destroyed, any subsequent get() call will create a new
 *  tracker instance.
 *
 *  Each object allocation is registered by the tracker. At any time, the application can call
 *  ObjectTracker::check_for_leaks() to determine, if there are any wrapper objects alive. If so,
 *  brief info on each such instance will be printed out to stdout.
 *
 *  Object Tracker is not thread-safe at the moment.

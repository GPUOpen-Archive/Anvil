/** Defines a MemoryBlock class, which is a wrapper for Vulkan device memory objects.
 *
 *  Additionally, the class:
 *
 *  - provides a read() function which works for buffer objects with coherent & non-coherent
 *    memory backing.
 *  - provides a write() function which works just as read().
 *  - if more than one read() or write() calls is necessary, the class exposes a function which
 *    lets its users map the block's storage into process space. Then, the user should issue
 *    a number of read & write ops, after which the object can be unmapped.
 *  - provides a way to create derivative memory blocks, whose storage is "carved out" of the
 *    parent memory block's.
